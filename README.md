### Intro
#### Summary:
In a construction site, logistic management and assemble sequence are interweaved in a complex way, which becomes a significant challenge to manage those tasks in order without a proper label-and-guild system.

The goal of this project is to redesign the GUI (graphical user interface) construction system by introducing a labeling-and-guiding application with customized physical components, helping workers easily find materials and assemble buildings.

#### Problem Definition:
Construction workers rely heavily on shop 2D drawings to implement assembling tasks, which include information about the material logistics management
and assembling sequence. However, it's not handy to keep tracking those labeled materials on-site and how they assemble one another due to the low fidelity of 2D information on shop drawing, leading to a waste of time and labor. The need to get high fidelity of 3D information inspires this project.

#### Ideation:
To access 3D information, we introduce two tools, a labeling-and-guiding system and customized physical components (embedded with graphical QR codes). The labeling-and-guiding system allows users to access labeled components to their information, like material
properties, store location, and how-to assemble. Hence, workers can find the components and get informed on assembling tasks by scanning graphical labels on components, optimizing the on-site construction process with an augmented-reality technology.
